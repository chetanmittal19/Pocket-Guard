    <string name="magnetometer_instructions">Installation of Hidden Cameras at various public places used by woman has been one of the greatest havoc problems of women\'s self respect and dignity. So, this feature of Pocket Guard helps women to detect hidden cameras anywhere.\n\nTypes of Hidden cameras :-\n\n1. Hidden cameras which emit IR rays :-\n\nYour phone\'s camera with night vision can detect the blinking of these rays same as we test the remote control of TV.\n\n2. Advanced Electronic Hidden cameras :-\n\nThese cameras do not emit IR rays but as these are electronic cameras so they radiate Electromagnetic radiations.\n\nAnd we have developed a simulation by the help of the magnetometer sensor of your phone which helps you detect any electronic device.\nBut as the hidden cameras are installed mostly at those places where use of electronic devices is not needed. So, detecting any electronic device at those places ensures the chances of spy camera installation. You have to just move and scan all the suspected places by your phone and if there is any hidden camera then Pocket Guard will start beeping. Make sure that the phone is very much close to the suspected area.</string>
